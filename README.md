This was a project completed during my time at Wyncode Full Stack bootcamp. This is a clone to amazon with a funny twist. Based on the way it was built it could be easily transformed to a working ecommerce application. The build was done with Ruby on Rails. 

*Ruby 2.4.1

*Postgresql

*Images stored in AWS Bucket
